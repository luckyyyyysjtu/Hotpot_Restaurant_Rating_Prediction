# Hotpot_Restaurant_Rating_Prediction

This repository compiles restaurant data sourced from the renowned Chinese restaurant review website, DazhongDianPing. Employing web crawling skills, it systematically gathers details encompassing taste, environment, service, branch, location, and pricing information for hotpot establishments in Shanghai. The primary objective is to address the predictive challenge of determining whether a restaurant merits a 5-star rating. This is accomplished through the implementation of three distinct machine learning models: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN).
